# **SOMM WINE BAR**

A responsive modern website for a recently open wine bar in ennis, this website was created as my first milestone project in the code institute full stack software development course.

## **Project goals**
While consulting with the owners of the wine bar the following main goals where established: 
- Create an online presence for the business to complement their social media presence
- Increase awareness about what the business is about and has to offer
- Increase potential customers for the business
- Allow new and current customers to book online

## **UXD**

Primary target audience: aged 21 years old upward people who are into the wine drinking experience or people who like wine but have not been to a wine bar before and what to learn more about what this experience has to offer 
 
**What is the website for:**
- To showcase the business and what it has to offer to potential and current customers
- To allow customers to learn more about the business
- To give customers the ability to contact the business

The **strategy** is to create a website where the customer can book a table by filling out a form, the customer can easily find out about what the business does where to find it and contact them, the customer can see what the business looks like inside and out, the user can see the businesses menus, offers and news

**What is culturally appropriate?** The older audience may not interact too much with the website and prefer to call the business directly to book and most online bookings are on a smart phone these days the goal is to attract a wide age group above age 21 
 
 The **strategy** is to  maximise the responsive design in the website to make it simple for older less tech savy audience to get info like address and phone number for the business but also to make the website feel modern sleek and attractive to younger people who commonly use their smartphones or tablets as their main web access

**Why makes this so special?** Most restaurant and bar type business have websites but these can be dated and unresponsive making them difficult to navigate on a mobile device for example the menu can be difficult to read on a mobile and would need to be zoomed in on to see properly this can be a tedious task and is generally off putting, also because a lot of business rely heavily on reviews on other websites to drive customer base their websites arenâ€™t very appealing to the eye.

The **strategy** is to make this a modern website which stands out from the other restaurant and bar websites by being both visually appealing and simple to navigate espically in the menus where people need to be able read the menu properly on any device without having to pinch and zoom 

## **User stories**
After interviewing the owner and potiental customers of the site and after doing some research the following users stories where created

### **Design decisions and structure**
Following the user stories I decided that to minimize the content and maximise the usability the website would consist of three pages home page , bookings page and menu page. Each page would have the same header and footer content to keep the website consistent and each page would consist of lots of imagery to make the webpage attractive and to show off the bar to give the user a bigger picture as to want the bar is all about the follow are my initial ideas on the project:

**Header** 

The header will consist of the logo of the company as well as the nav links to the other sections of the site these will be displayed inline on larger devices and as a hamburger menu on smaller devices this will make the site easy to navigate for any user

**Footer**

The footer will consist of a contact info, address, a mini embedded map,social media links this will increase usability by giving this info on every page the site

**Home page**

The home page will have a nice image of the bar , it will have a call to action to book a table and a slogan. further down the page will be the about section with a sign up button for the newletter as a modal and social media links. The next section will be some nice imagery which be about the menu and will link to the menu page.

**Booking page**

The booking page will be a simple page with a nice image, a form for booking a table at the bar and some text at top to inform customers again about the contact info. This will make it easy to book a table and not distract form that process with other content this is why I decided to give it its own page

**Menu page** 

The menu will be layed out over images to section each element of the menu. The content will fill out a desktop screen but will be displayed in list type format on a tablet or mobile the device for easy reading and scrolling through the content

### **Wireframing**

After answering the user stories and getting a idea of the features needed on the site and the information structure of the site I started the wireframing process with balsamiq this helped to solidify my ideas about how the site would look and also help me make the site more attractive by laying out the imagery in the correct pattern and choosing the colors of the font and backgrounds

**View wireframes here:**

- [Home page](https://github.com/noelmurphy33/SOMM/blob/41105cbf5d1e2999ab019d2754392354f00d8903/wireframes/home-wireframe.png)

### **Changes to initial design**

After a review of the design and wireframes by my mentor the following changes where decided.
1. The booking page will be changed to a contact page which will remove the contact info from the footer and place it on the page along with a contact form

2. The booking nav link and call to action will now be a modal form.

3. The sign up to newletter call to action will be removed from the about section and will now be in the foooter as a small form 

### **Colors**

The following colors where used throughout the website
- rgba(29, 29, 29, 0.979) mainly for the backgrounds
- rgba(181, 7, 23, 1) used for brand color and titles alwell as links
- rgba(191, 191, 191, 1) used for font throughout website
- rgb(10, 10, 10) used as background for title on menu and contact page.

the form is full width on small devices and 50% on larger screens.

### **FUTURE FEATURES**
These are ideas to add in the future but couldnt for the moment due to lack of knowledge.
- Validation messages for the forms as feedback to the user in paricular the booking form to show availability
- a section where people can post reviews directly to the site

- [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) used to compress the filesize for the images.
- [Mircosoft Photos](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
used to resize the images.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) used to create the wireframes.

- [W3C css validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) used to test my style sheet.

## **TESTING**
The testing of the site was a continuous process throughout the development
because of my lack of experiance i was keen to test each part i had completed this was 
done mostly using chrome dev tools on my laptop but also on my personal devices both android and ios 
mobile devices as well as on different browsers on each device. i also had some friends test the site once i had
completed most of the coding.

#### validaters
I used W3C mark up and css validaters to test each page of the website.

intially i used these validaters once i had completeted the index.html page 
to ensure i wasnt making any big errors the results showed two errors and several warnings

**.1** error with the width and height properties of the google maps iframe

**.2**  an error for using the incorrect < h > tag for the title of the social media
icons.

These errors where fix by changing the < h > tag and by moving the width and height propertys
to the style attribute.

**warnings**
intially i had several warnings due to my comments not having equal hyphens
but this was an easy fix.

The final testing of my html files showed no errors or warnings.

**CSS**
The css validation showed no errors or warnings untill i added the vendor prefixs 
with autoprefixer. The warnings show unknown vender prefixs
but from what i understand from searching this topic this is because the validaters
dont recognize the code.

##### **DEV TOOLS**
i used chrome dev tools alot while testing this site to make sure the site was responsive
and rendered correct on every screen size to my knowledge the site should look correct on any screensize.
i used lighthouse in dev tools and made adjustment to my code to improve the performance, acessibility, seo and best practices.

 ##### Browser compatability
 I tested the website on the following browsers
 - Mircosoft edge
 - Opera
 - Google chrome
 - Mozilla Firefox 
 - Safari 

 The only issue i found while checking the browser compatability was on safari 
 but the same issue with the parralax effect of the background images occurs on any browser
 on an ios device see [BUGS](#BUGS) section for more detail.
